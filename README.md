# House-Price-Prediction1
PROBLEM STATEMENT - Prices of House are sophisticatedly linked with our economy. Despite this, we do not have accurate measures of housing prices based on the vast amount of data available. Therefore, the goal of this project is to use machine learning to predict the selling prices of houses based on many economic factors and thus, it requires fewer data points for training. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we will do model evaluation .For this we have taken dataset from kaggle from this link (https://www.kaggle.com/code/ralfheidig/predicting-house-prices-with-linear-regression/data) and it contains N no columns so we will find the relationship between dependent and independent features on sales price and then eliminate the unnecessary columns. Former analyses have found that the prices of houses in that dataset are most strongly dependent on their (Size, locality, Yr built and the geographical location). We are working on predicting house prices based on regression analysis and machine learning techniques.LinearRegression, Lasso,Ridge,RandomForestRegresion,polynomialregresion can be used to forecast prices.![189518816-cc24cc41-5e72-4b4c-af9f-a3c59eeff59c](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108938132/192512334-6a997659-5ccd-41eb-aa4b-27d9946c488b.png)
